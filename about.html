      <h3>About Us</h3>
<p class='openpara'>
  Headlamp Restoration Services use a variety of techniques and a number of stages to ensure the headlights on your vehicle are returned to a crystal clear, bright, shiny state and will pass the MOT test.
</p>
<p>
  We use Delta systems for headlamp restorations. Imported from the USA we find this process and equipment produces the best and most consistent results.
</p>
<p>
  Stages of restoration include cleaning, various sanding & polishing stages followed by coating the headlights with protective solution which prolongs the life of the headlights and helps to prevent the problem recurring.  Not all of our competitors offer this final stage and indeed most of the diy kits available do not include the coating solution which often means the headlamps require further treatments, sometimes within a few months.  Therefore we suggest to provide the most long term, cost effective treatment for your vehicle headlights and increase its value, call us on
