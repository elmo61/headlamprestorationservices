  Most of today’s vehicle headlights are made of polycarbonate plastic in order to make them impact resistant, lighter and easier to mould into the fancy shapes found on modern cars. However many of these vehicles now have hazy, cloudy, yellowing or oxidised headlight lenses caused by the sun's UV rays, chemicals used on the road surface and by emissions from vehicle exhaust systems.
</p>
<p>This can lead to poor vehicle appearance, compromises road safety and a reduction in the vehicle's value. Reduced night-time visibility means road hazards become even more dangerous. Damaged headlights may also result in the vehicle failing the MOT test. Anything that alters the pattern of light through the lens, such as misty, scratched, or oxidised outer covers, could result in failure and a great deal of expense to replace the complete unit.</p>

<h4>Our Services</h4>
<p>
  However help is now at hand at a fraction of the cost of replacing complete headlight units (sometimes running into hundreds of pounds per light) and the high labour costs involved in fitting (often in excess of £100 plus vat per hour)
</p>
<p>
  Our headlight restoration service removes the damaged, yellow, cloudy, oxidised layers and leaves your vehicle with crisp clear headlights and looking like new again. All at a fraction of the cost of replacement and usually without the need to remove the headlamps from the vehicle.
